Prior to tissue digestion, lung homogenates were cleared from excessive blood by addition of 35 ml of ice-cold PBS, followed by gentle shaking and tissue collection using a 40μm strainer. The bloody filtrate was discarded. The tissue was transferred into 8 ml of enzyme mix consisting of dispase (50 caseinolytic U/ml), collagenase (2 mg/ml), elastase (1 mg/ml), and DNase (30 µg/ml) for mild enzymatic digestion for 1 hour at 37°C while shaking. Enzyme activity was inhibited by adding 5 ml of PBS supplemented with 10% FCS. Dissociated cells in suspension were passed through a 70μm strainer and centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer and incubated at room temperature for 2 minutes to lyse remaining red blood cells. After incubation, 10 ml of PBS supplemented with 10% FCS was added to the suspension and the mix was centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The cells were taken up in 1 ml of PBS supplemented with 10% FCS, counted using a Neubauer chamber and critically assessed for single cell separation. Dead cells were counted to calculate the overall cell viability, which needed to be above 85% to continue with Drop-Seq. 250,000 cells were aliquoted in 2.5 ml of PBS supplemented with 0.04% of bovine serum albumin and loaded for Drop-Seq at a final concentration of 100 cells/μl.",Drop-seq,"The Drop-seq core computational pipeline was used for processing next generation sequencing reads of the scRNA-seq data, as previously described (Pubmed ID: 26000488).",GPL20301,"Lukas,,Simon",THINC,Baylor College of Medicine,1 Baylor Plaza,Houston,77030,USA,Illumina HiSeq 4000,cDNA,transcriptomic,RNA-Seq,BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN11477230,NONE,GSE130148,0
