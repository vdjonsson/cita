GentleMACS programs; h_tumor_01, 02, and 02 were run with two 30 min incubation in the MACSmix tube rotator at 37 oC. (2) Normal lymph node tissue and biopsy samples of metastatic lymph node and lung tumour tissue were dissociated using Collagenase/Hyaluronidase and DNase I. The tissue was chopped into 2-4 mm pieces with a sterile scissor in a 35 mm dish and incubated in an enzyme solution (Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) and DNase I (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) in RPMI1640 media) at 37 oC for 1 hour.
